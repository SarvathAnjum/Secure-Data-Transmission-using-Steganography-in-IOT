# Secure-Data-Transmission-using-Steganography-in-IOT
A secure system was developed to transfer secret data from one point to another by making use of the technique called Image Steganography based on the live images captured from an IOT environment. The IOT environment consisted of a PIR motion detection sensor which was connected with an ESP32-Cam to capture images.
